## Project Overview
Tanzania, with a population of over 57 million, faces significant challenges in providing access to clean water, a fundamental need for its citizens. The country has numerous water points spread across its vast landscape, but many of these wells have deteriorated over time. Some are fully functional, others require repair, and some have failed completely. This project focuses on building a classifier to predict the condition of these water wells, leveraging various data points such as the type of pump used, installation dates, geographic location, and other relevant factors. The outcome of this model will be crucial for organizations like NGOs and the Tanzanian government to prioritize and allocate resources effectively, ensuring better water access for the population.

## Business Understanding
Ensuring the functionality of water wells is critical to providing safe and clean water to communities, particularly in a developing country like Tanzania. The failure of these water points can have severe consequences, leading to water scarcity, poor hygiene, and health issues. For stakeholders such as the Tanzanian government and NGOs, understanding the factors that contribute to the deterioration of wells can drive strategic decisions, such as where to allocate repair resources or how to design more durable wells in the future. This project aims to address this need by developing a predictive model that can classify the condition of wells, enabling these stakeholders to act proactively in maintaining water accessibility.

## Objectives
The overarching goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate classification model that can predict the condition of water wells in Tanzania. This model will assist in identifying wells that are likely to fail, enabling stakeholders to take preventive measures. By understanding the key factors influencing well functionality, the project will also provide insights that can be used to improve the design and maintenance of future water points. Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to a more reliable water supply infrastructure in Tanzania, improving the quality of life for its residents.

### Main Objectives
1. Analyzing the data to identify the most significant factors contributing to the condition of the wells.<br>
2. Building a predictive model that can classify water wells into one of three categories: functional, in need of repair, or non-functional.<br>
3. Providing actionable insights and recommendations to stakeholders, such as NGOs and the Tanzanian government, to guide their efforts in maintaining and improving water well infrastructure.<br>

### Specific Objectives
1. Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.<br>
2. Developing and fine-tuning a machine learning model for classification to predict well conditions.<br>
3. Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.<br>
4. Interpreting the model's results to provide clear, actionable recommendations for stakeholders.<br>

## Data Understanding
The dataset for this project comprises detailed information on water wells across Tanzania, including variables such as; the type of pump installed, the year of installation, and the geographic coordinates of each well. Additional features may include the depth of the well, the source of water, and the materials used in construction. Understanding the distribution of these features and their potential impact on well functionality is crucial for building an effective classification model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to summarize and visualize the main characteristics of our datasets. This process will helps us uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using various statistical graphics and data visualization methods. By employing summary statistics and visual tools like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heat maps, we aim to understand the underlying structure of the data and identify relationships between variables, which will help us provide the investor with insights.

## Feature Importance Analysis
Tree-based models like Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, and LightGBM can provide insights into feature importance based on their internal algorithms. This section extracts and visualizes the importance of different features as determined by these models, highlighting which features most influence predictions.
## Results and Insights 

### Findings
1.High number of functional wells in regions like Dodoma and Manyara.<br>
2.Significant non-functional wells in regions like Shinyanga and Mtwara.<br>
3.Majority of functional wells have soft water quality.<br>
4.Gravity pumps have the highest count of functional wells.<br>
5.Handpumps and submersible pumps have notable counts of non-functional wells.<br>

### Recommendations
1.Focus maintenance efforts on regions with high numbers of non-functional wells (e.g., Shinyanga and Mtwara).<br>
2.Consider the high reliability of gravity pumps and the challenges faced by handpumps and submersible pumps.<br>
3.Address water quality issues in regions with non-functional wells, especially those with salty and milky water.<br>
4.Implement water treatment solutions or alternative water sources.<br>
5.Map the distribution of well conditions and pump types to identify regional patterns.<br>
6.Analyze changes in well conditions over time to assess the effectiveness of past interventions.<br>
7.Work with NGOs and government agencies to implement targeted interventions based on model predictions.<br>
